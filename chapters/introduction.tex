\chapter{Introduction}
\section{Overview}
In today's interconnected digital landscape, the security of computer networks is of paramount
importance. With the increasing sophistication of cyber threats, organizations face a constant
challenge in safeguarding their networks from unauthorized access, malicious activities, and data
breaches. One crucial component of a comprehensive cybersecurity strategy is the Network
Intrusion Detection System (NIDS). A Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) is a vital
security tool designed to monitor network traffic in real-time, identifying and alerting administrators
to suspicious or potentially harmful activities. By analyzing network packets and patterns, NIDS
can detect various types of attacks, including malware infections, unauthorized access attempts,
denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, and more. This mini project report aims to explore the fundamentals
of Network Intrusion Detection Systems, including their functionalities, architecture, detection
techniques, and deployment strategies. Additionally, it will discuss the importance of NIDS in
enhancing network security posture, mitigating risks, and safeguarding critical assets against cyber
threats. Through this project, we seek to gain a deeper understanding of NIDS and its role in modern
cybersecurity practices, providing insights into its implementation, configuration, and effectiveness
in protecting network infrastructures from emerging threats.

The architecture of a typical NIDS consists of sensors strategically deployed throughout the
network infrastructure to capture and analyze traffic. These sensors can be hardware-based
appliances, software applications running on dedicated servers, or even virtual appliances
deployed in cloud environments. Central to the NIDS architecture is the analysis engine,
responsible for processing and correlating network data collected by the sensors, identifying
suspicious patterns, and generating alerts for further investigation. NIDS operates by
inspecting incoming and outgoing network traffic, comparing it against pre-defined signatures
or behavioral patterns indicative of known attacks or anomalies. Signature-based detection
involves matching network traffic against a database of predefined attack patterns or signatures,
allowing NIDS to recognize and respond to known threats effectively. On the other hand,
anomaly-based detection relies on establishing a baseline of normal network behavior and
flagging deviations from this baseline as potential intrusions. Additionally, some NIDS
solutions utilize a combination of signature-based and anomaly-based detection techniques for
enhanced accuracy and coverage.

\section{About the Project}
The "Network Intrusion Detection Using ML" project focuses on developing an advanced
intrusion detection system by harnessing machine learning (ML) algorithms and
methodologies. The primary goal is to design ML-based models capable of detecting and
mitigating various types of network intrusions, such as unauthorized access, malware
infections, data exfiltration, and insider threats. By training these models on labeled datasets
containing normal and malicious network traffic, the project aims to enhance network security
by leveraging ML's ability to identify sophisticated attacks that traditional methods may miss.
The initiative seeks to address the challenges posed by the evolving cyber threat landscape and
bolster the resilience of organizational networks against emerging security risks.

\section{Motivation}
The motivation behind the "Network Intrusion Detection Using ML" project is driven by the
exponential growth of cyber threats and attacks, which have posed significant challenges to the
